# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Set up your environment by following these [instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/) from Expo.
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app
- For android
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```
  
- For iOS
   ```bash
  npx expo run:ios
   ```
  
- or 
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
and select from the menu

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
